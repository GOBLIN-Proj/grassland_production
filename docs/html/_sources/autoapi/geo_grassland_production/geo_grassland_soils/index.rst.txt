   Grassland Soils Module
   ========================
   This module contains the SoilGroups class, which is responsible for managing and analyzing
   soil group data related to various cohorts. It focuses on categorizing and
   distributing soil types among different livestock categories like dairy, beef, and sheep.
   The module utilizes several components from the grassland_production package to
   compute and provide detailed insights into soil group distributions for grassland management.

   Classes:
       SoilGroups: Manages soil group data.

.. py:class:: SoilGroups(ef_country, calibration_year, target_year, scenario_data, scenario_animals_df, baseline_animals_df)


   A class to manage and analyze soil group data for different grassland cohorts.

   The SoilGroups class integrates data from various sources to provide a comprehensive
   overview of soil group distribution across different types of livestock systems, such as
   dairy, beef, and sheep. It plays a crucial role in understanding and managing
   soil-related aspects in grassland areas.

   :param ef_country: The country for which the analysis is performed.
   :type ef_country: str
   :param calibration_year: The calibration year.
   :type calibration_year: int
   :param target_year: The target year for future scenario projections.
   :type target_year: int
   :param scenario_inputs_df: DataFrame containing scenario input variables data.
   :type scenario_inputs_df: DataFrame
   :param scenario_animals_df: DataFrame containing scenario animal data.
   :type scenario_animals_df: DataFrame
   :param baseline_animals_df: DataFrame containing baseline animal data.
   :type baseline_animals_df: DataFrame

   .. attribute:: data_manager_class

      Manages and processes grassland data.

      :type: DataManager

   .. attribute:: calibration_year

      Year of data calibration.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: target_year

      Target year for data analysis.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: default_calibration_year

      Default year used for calibration in case of data discrepancies.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: loader_class

      Class for loading necessary data.

      :type: Loader

   .. attribute:: scenario_animals_df

      Dataframe containing animal data for different scenarios.

      :type: DataFrame

   .. attribute:: baseline_animals_df

      Dataframe containing baseline animal data.

      :type: DataFrame

   .. attribute:: dairy_soil_distribution

      Soil distribution data for dairy grasslands.

      :type: DataFrame

   .. attribute:: beef_soil_distribution

      Soil distribution data for beef grasslands.

      :type: DataFrame

   .. attribute:: sheep_soil_distribution

      Soil distribution data for sheep grasslands.

      :type: DataFrame

   .. attribute:: grassland_class

      Class for managing grassland data.

      :type: Grasslands

   .. method:: get_cohort_soil_groups()

      Computes and returns the soil group distribution for spared (destocked) areas.
      

   .. py:method:: get_cohort_soil_groups()

      Computes and returns a detailed breakdown of soil groups across different livestock cohorts for spared areas.

      This method analyzes soil distribution among various cohorts (such as dairy, beef,
      and sheep) and their respective spared (destocked) areas. It calculates the area for each soil group
      within each cohort by applying area multipliers based on the calibration year data.
      In cases where data for the specified calibration year is not available, it defaults to
      using data from a predefined default calibration year.

      The method iterates over all combinations of scenarios, soil groups, and cohorts to
      compile a comprehensive dataset representing the distribution of soil groups within destocked (spared) areas.

      :returns:

                A dataframe containing columns for scenario, year, cohort, soil group,
                        and calculated area in hectares (ha). This dataframe provides a detailed
                        view of how different soil groups are distributed within spared areas based on livstock cohorts.
