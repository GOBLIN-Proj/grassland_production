   Farm Data Module
   ==================

   This module includes the FarmData class which is responsible for computing various aspects of farm data,
   such as fertilization totals and farm data in different scenarios. This data is essential for lifecycle
   assessment calculations and agricultural planning.

   Classes:
       FarmData: Manages the computation of farm data for lifecycle assessments and scenario analysis.

   The FarmData class handles the computation of various farm-related data elements, including
   fertilization rates and overall farm data for baseline and future scenarios. This class plays
   a pivotal role in lifecycle assessment and agricultural scenario analysis by providing essential
   data for these processes.

      The calibration year.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: default_calibration_year

      The default calibration year.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: default_grassland_year

      The default grassland year.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: target_year

      The target year.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: areas_class

      An instance of the Areas class.

      :type: Areas

   .. attribute:: grassland_class

      An instance of the Grasslands class.

      :type: Grasslands

   .. attribute:: fertiliser_class

      An instance of the Fertilisation class.

      :type: Fertilisation

   .. method:: compute_fertilization_total()

      
      Calculates the total fertilization rates across different scenarios, considering various livestock
      systems and grassland types.
      

   .. method:: compute_farm_data_in_scenarios()

      
      Computes farm data required for lifecycle assessment in different future scenarios.
      

   .. method:: compute_farm_data_in_baseline()

      
      Computes baseline farm data for use in lifecycle assessments and scenario comparisons.
      

   .. py:method:: compute_fertilization_total()

      Calculation of total fertilisation rate across scenarios.

      This function aggregates the values for the livestock systems (Dairy, Beef, Sheep) and grassland types (Pasture, Silage, Hay, Rough grazing in use).

      If the year is less than 2005, outside the NFS range, a mean value across years is used.

      For past years, the livestock system proportions for that year are utilised in the calculations as weights for grassland types.
      Again, a mean value is used for past years outside the NFS range.
      In relation to the target year and the grassland type weights, the calibration year is used.

      The self.fert_rate_total is used to set the farm_data



   .. py:method:: compute_farm_data_in_scenarios()

      Computes farm data for various future scenarios to be used in lifecycle assessment (LCA) calculations.
      This method integrates data on fertilizer usage, urea proportions, and other farm-specific details to
      generate a comprehensive dataset for each scenario.

      The computation involves determining the proportions of different types of fertilizers (P, K, Lime) and
      calculating the total usage of each based on the fertilization rates and scenarios. It also accounts for
      urea usage and abatement (abated urea) in the scenarios.

      :returns:

                A pandas DataFrame with farm data for each scenario. Each row corresponds to a scenario,
                        including information about fertilizer usage, urea proportions, and other essential data
                        for LCA calculations.
      :rtype: DataFrame

      .. rubric:: Notes

      - The method attempts to use the calibration year data; if unavailable, it falls back to a default year.
      - Data includes total amounts of urea, lime, nitrogenous (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers,
      along with diesel and electricity usage.
      - Diesel and Eelectricity usage are set to 0 for now, as they are not used in the current GOBLIN model.


   .. py:method:: compute_farm_data_in_baseline()

      Computes baseline farm data for use in lifecycle assessment (LCA) calculations. This method focuses on
      generating a dataset reflecting the baseline agricultural practices and inputs for the calibration year,
      which serves as a reference point.

      The computation includes the assessment of various types of fertilizers (P, K, Lime, Urea) and their
      quantities used in the calibration year. It also accounts for diesel and electricity (currently set to zero) usage in farming
      operations.

      :returns:

                A pandas DataFrame containing baseline farm data. It includes detailed information about
                        fertilizer usage, urea proportions, and other essential data elements for LCA calculations.
      :rtype: DataFrame

      .. rubric:: Notes

      - The method attempts to use the data from the calibration year; if unavailable, it falls back to a
      default year.
      - This method is essential for establishing a baseline in LCA studies, against which future scenarios
      and changes in agricultural practices can be compared.
      - Data includes total amounts of urea, lime, nitrogenous (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers,
      along with diesel and electricity usage.
      - Diesel and Eelectricity usage are set to 0 for now, as they are not used in the current GOBLIN model.
